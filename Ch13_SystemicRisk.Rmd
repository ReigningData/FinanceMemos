This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
mtx <- read.csv("~/Data_Science/FinanceMemos/mtx.csv", sep=";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)%>% as.matrix()
adj_mtx <- mtx
#If there is a N/A, put a 0 to indicate no lending
adj_mtx[is.na(adj_mtx)] <- 0
#If there is a number (amt lent) put a 1 to indicate lending
adj_mtx[adj_mtx != 0] <- 1

#Create graph object
G <- graph.adjacency(adj_mtx, mode = "undirected")
#Identify the largest cliques (there are 7)
CORE <- largest.cliques(G)

#loop through and create network diagrams for the 7 largest cliques
for ( i in 1:length(CORE)){
    core <- CORE[[i]]
    periphery <- setdiff(1:33, core)
    V(G)$color[periphery] <- rgb(0,1,0)
    V(G)$color[core] <- rgb(1,0,0)
    print(i)
    print(core)
    print(periphery)
    H <- induced_subgraph(G, periphery)
    d <- mean(degree(H))
    #core nodes are red periphery are green
    plot(G, 
         layout = layout.fruchterman.reingold,
         vertex.color = V(G)$color, 
         vertex.size = 25, 
         vertex.label.color = "white",
         vertex.label.family = "sans",
         edge.width = 2,
         main = paste("Avg periphery degree:", round(d, 2)))
}
```
